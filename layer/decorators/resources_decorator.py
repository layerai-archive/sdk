    Syncs arbitrary files between local and fabric environments.
    ``@resources`` decorator can be applied to the functions that are wrapped by the ``@dataset`` or ``@model`` decorators.

    :param path: File or directory path, could be relative or absolute. If path is a directory, all directories and files are uploaded recursively.
    :param paths: Additional paths.
    :return: Function object being decorated.

        import pandas as pd
        from layer
        from layer.decorators import dataset, resources

        @dataset("titanic")
        @resources("data/titanic.csv")
        def titanic():
            return pd.read_csv("data/titanic.csv")

    When you execute ``layer.run([titanic])``, the following happens:
    - Function ``titanic`` is submitted to Layer fabric, ``data/titanic.csv`` is uploaded to internal resource storage.
    - Before the execution, fabric runtime downloads the resource ``data/titanic.csv`` and makes it available to use within the function scope.

    If you have multiple resources, separate them with commas.

    .. code-block:: python

        @resources("path", "path1", "path2")

    **Note:** while absolute or relative paths are allowed as parameters to ``@resources``, they should always be relative when used within function body. For example:

    .. code-block:: python

        @dataset("titanic")
        @resources("/data/titanic.csv")  # it's ok to use absolute paths as they're resolved on the local machine
        def titanic():
            return pd.read_csv("data/titanic.csv")  # while run inside function fabric, always use the relative paths!

    #### Limitations:
    - You can upload a maximum of 1000 files
    - Total upload size is limited to 5GB
